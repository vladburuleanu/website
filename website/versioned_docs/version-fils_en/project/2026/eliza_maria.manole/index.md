## Description
RoboMop is a multi-sensor autonomous cleaning robot built on a 4WD car platform and is controlled by a Nucleo STM32U545RE-Q microcontroller, but also has remote WiFi capabilities through the ESP32 controller. 
My system uses multiple ultrasonic sensors for environmental which facilitate obstacle avoidance and navigation. The machine has a dual servo-driven mechanism placed at the rear side that moves up and down and side to side creating a real cleaning motion with the help of a sponge.
Also, an LCD display is placed on the machine to monitor the cleaning status and the runtime.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to create a simple, low-cost and very practical cleaning robot that uses embedded systems programming in Rust, Real-Time motor and servo control autonomous movement with the help of the 4 different wheel motors and multiple other components. Personally, I love cleaning and this robot helps me keep my room tidy easily.

## Architecture
The system is structured around two main subsystems: the real-time control unit and the communication unit. 
The STM32 communicates with all components through different interfaces:
- **GPIO:** ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection that are placed on the front and sides of the car
- **PWM:** controls DC motors via L298N and the servo motors for the cleaning mechanism
- **I2C:** LCD Display that is used for the cleaning status and runtime
- **UART:** Communication with ESP32 for WiFi control and data exchange
- **Timers:** Used for precise timing and task scheduling

## Log
### Week 2-4
Form my first ideas and search ideas for my project.
### Week 5-7
Researched the market for the adequate components for the RoboMop and placing all the orders.
### Week 8
I received the components and tested them to ensure proper functionality.
### Week 9
Starting to assemble the project.

## Hardware
The physical pary of my project consists of the STM32U545RE-Q microcontroller as the main source of processing power. The ESP32 module enables the user to remotely communicate with the STM32 in order to give out commands.The ultrasonic sensors detect any unwanted objects in the way of the car, each wheel is powered by a motor and the most important part of the machine is the dual servo powered cleaning system that can move up and down and side to side in order for it to adapt to different cleaning scenarious.
