## Description

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive robotic arm that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using a STM32 Nucleo microcontroller and the Rust programming language. It utilizes a Python-based MediaPipe AI model for real-time gesture recognition via webcam and communicates the results to the hardware via UART. The robotic hand is 3D-printed and uses servo motors to physically mimic the 3 possibilities - rock, paper or scissors. An OLED display tracks the score. The system integrates asynchronous Rust (Embassy) for hardware control and an ESP module to enable remote scoreboard access via WiFi.

## Motivation

This project combines Computer Vision and Embedded Rust, transforming digital gesture recognition into physical robotic motion. By implementing the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, the project  creates an interactive experience that demonstrates the power of asynchronous firmware in handling complex, real-time user interactions. So, the motivation was to have a tangible, end-to-end system, that feels like a challenge for both myself in building it and for the people interacting with it afterwards, when they play the game.

## Log

### Weeks 5-6

 - Researched possible project ideas and chose the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
 - Researched different development boards and selected the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q as the main microcontroller
 - Ordered STM32

 ### Weeks 7-8

 - Researched additional hardware components and implementation methods
 - Ordered the necessary materials and performed initial functionality tests on the purchased modules

 ### Weeks 9-10

 - Searched for a suitable 3D-printable robotic hand that can be adapted to project requirements and looking to start the 3D printing process
 - Researched how to connect the hardware components together 

 ### Week 11

 - Completed the 3D printing process for the robotic hand
 - Started integrating the electronic components with the printed structure

## Hardware

The hardware platform of the project is centered around the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q development board, which acts as the main controller of the robotic arm. The SG90 servo motors are used to actuate the fingers of the hand and reproduce the rock, paper, and scissors gestures. A 0.96-inch SSD1306 OLED display connected through I2C is used to show the score and game status. Wireless connectivity is provided by an ESP-01 WiFi module communicating with the STM32 through UART. Gesture recognition is performed on a laptop using a USB webcam or the integrated camera. For prototyping and interconnections, a breadboard and jumper wires are used. The robotic hand itself is manufactured using 3D printing, while the system is powered by a 5V external power supply.
