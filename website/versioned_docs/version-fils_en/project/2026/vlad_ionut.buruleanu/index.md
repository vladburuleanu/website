## Description
The aim of this project is to build a reliable UAV system that includes:
- The drone itself
- A flight controller that actuates control surfaces and sends over telemetry
- The ground station that is used to pilot the drone remotely

## Motivation

Commercial RC drones and receiver/transmitter systems are often expensive. The goal is to develop a similar system on a smaller budget with some parts I already have lying around.


## Architecture

## Log

# Weeks 5-6

Ordered necessary hardware components and started the development process of the drone, running simulations and making rough calculations to figure out optimal flight configuration.

# Weeks 7-8

Finished 3d design of wing and tail structure.

# Week 9-10

# Week 11-12

# Week 13-14
Designed and laser-cut the drone elements from balsa and ply wood.
Assembled the main wing and ampenage.
Due to time constraints I replaced the raspberry pi pico with an stm32 for faster development.
NRF24L01 modeules turned out to be broken after a long trobleshooting session, so i will have to resort to a wired demonstrarion.

## Hardware

The flight controller is designed around a Raspberry pi pico 2W microcontroller which controls the servo motors and brushlless(via PWM) motor responsible for actuating the control surfaces and providing thrust. The microcontroller is further responsible with collecting and sending telemetry data to the ground station via the NRF24L01+ RF module(via SPI). Telemetry data includes battery level and link quality. The battery level will be measured by reading the battery voltage from the balance pins with a voltage divider to protect the sensitive analog pins of the raspberry pi. Reverse polarity protection is added using a P-channel  Mosfet.

The Ground Station is centered around a Raspberry pi Zero 2W, who's main purpose is to take input from an XBOX360 controller and transmit it over to the drone. It also displays some telemetry data on the OLED display.
